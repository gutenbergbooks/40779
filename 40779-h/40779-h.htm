<h3>
<span>BEN JONSON'S VERSES ON THE MARRIAGE OF THE EARL OF SOMERSET.</span>
</h3>

<p>The British Museum purchased for 14<i>l.</i> the copy of the 1640 edition of
Ben Jonson's <i>Works</i>, which was sold by Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson,
in the library of the Honorable Archibald Fraser of Lovat. The volume,
which had on its exterior covers the arms of Carr, Earl of Somerset,
contains on one of them the following inscription:&mdash;"These verses were
made by the author of this booke, and were delivered to the Earl of
Somerset upon his Lordship's wedding-day." Then follow the verses in the
poet's own handwriting.</p>

<p>We need scarcely point out the allusions in the eleventh and twelfth
lines to Sir T. Overbury's <i>Character of a Good Wife</i>; but we cannot
help calling attention to the curious fact that these lines, written in
1613, must have been carefully preserved by the unhappy man to whom they
were addressed, through all his trials and difficulties; and then, on
the publication of the 1640 edition of Rare Ben's <i>Works</i>,&mdash;twenty-seven
years after his disgraceful marriage, five years before his death,&mdash;been
pasted by him in the cover of the volume which is now very properly
deposited in the National Library.</p>



<h3>
<span>JUNIUS AND THE QUARTERLY REVIEW.</span>
</h3>

<p>Speculations about Junius are once again the fashion. I would recommend
the editor of "N. &amp; Q." not to enter on the general question; but there
are ways, within his legitimate province, by which he might do good
service. For example, there have been many obscure persons alluded to in
these discussions, about whom we should all be glad to receive
information. Thus, Mr. Combe, the author of <i>Dr. Syntax's Tour</i>, figures
prominently in the last number of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>. Now, of Mr.
Combe very little is known: his name never, I believe, appeared in a
title-page, although he lived, or rather starved, by literature, for
half a century. From a correspondent of <i>The Athenæum</i> I learn that a
list of Combe's works, in his own handwriting, is in the possession of
Mr. Robert Cole; and as Mr. Cole is said to be a very liberal man, I
have no doubt he would allow you to print that list. What a waste of
speculation, not on one subject, but many subjects, might thus be saved
to another generation of editors and contributors!</p>

<p>There are also numberless facts, or assumed facts, made to do duty in
these discussions, which might with great propriety be subjected to the
searching test of "N. &amp; Q." I submit one as a specimen. The writer of
the above-mentioned article in the <i>Quarterly</i> says: "It is universally
admitted that Junius must have been indefatigable in acquiring
information, and that he was pre-eminently distinguished by the variety
and extent of his knowledge;" and he then quotes from the <i>Parliamentary
History</i> the reported opinion of Burke on this point: "Were he [Junius]
a member of this House, what might not be expected from his
knowledge?... Nothing would escape his vigilance and activity. Bad
ministers could conceal nothing from his sagacity, nor could promises or
threats induce him to conceal anything from the public." On this I
desire to observe, that the "variety and extent" of the knowledge of
Junius is not universally admitted&mdash;has indeed been publicly denied; and
that what Burke said, as above quoted, had no reference to Junius
whatever, but to the author of <i>Another Letter to Mr. Almon in Matter of
Libel</i>, then just published, and believed to have been written by the
author of the still more celebrated pamphlet, published in 1763 or 1764,
called <i>A Letter concerning Libels and Warrants</i>, &amp;c. It is quite true
that the passage has been quoted, and so applied, twenty times, and been
forced to do double duty, that is, been adduced in proof of directly
opposite opinions. This was allowable up to 1842, but inexcusable since
the <i>Cavendish Debates</i> have been published. (See <i>Cav. Deb.</i>, vol. ii.
pp. 106, 107.)</p>

<h3>
<span>SIMON OF SUDBURY, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY.</span>
</h3>

<p>In a niche in the vestry of St. Gregory's Church, Sudbury, Suffolk, is
preserved the skull of the murdered archbishop: beneath the niche is
placed the following inscription, which appears to me worthy of a place
in your pages:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"The head of Simon Theobald, who was born at Sudbury, and thence
   called Simon of Sudbury; he was sent when but a youth into
   foreign parts to study the civil law, whereof he was made doctor:
   he visited most of the universities of France, was made chaplain
   to Pope Innocent, and auditor rotæ, or judge of the Roman court.
   By the interest of this Pope he was made Chancellor of Salisbury.
   In the year 1361, he was consecrated Bishop of London; and in the
   year 1375 was translated to the see of Canterbury, and made
   Chancellor of England. While he was Bishop of London he built the
   upper part of St. Gregory's in Sudbury; and where his father's
   house stood he erected a college of secular priests, and endowed
   it with the yearly revenue of one hundred and twenty-two pounds
   eighteen shillings, and was at length barbarously beheaded upon
   Tower Hill, in London, by the rabble in Wat Tyler's Rebellion, in
   the reign of Richard II. 1382."</p>

<p>This inscription is written in an old hand on a piece of parchment. On
turning to Stow's <i>Annales</i> for an account of these transactions, I find
a very interesting relation of the circumstances above mentioned. I
trust to be excused if I add a few brief extracts. King Richard had
ordered the Tower gates to be opened to the rebels, though&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "There was the same time in the Tower 600 warlike men, furnished
   with armour and weapon, expert men in armes, and 600 archers, all
   which did quaile in stomacke." </p>

<p class="author1">Stow's <i>Annales</i> (edit. 1601,   4to.), p. 457.</p>

<p class="noindent">The rebels having entered, conducted themselves with unbridled license,
and "with terrible noyse and fury" laid hands on the archbishop, "drew
him out of the chappell," and proceeded at once to put him to death:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"He, kneeling downe, offered his necke to him that should strike
   it off; being stricken in the necke, but not deadly, he putting
   his hande to his necke, said thus, <i>a ha</i>, it is the hand of God:
   he had not removed his hand from the place where the payne was,
   but that<a id="Page_195"></a> <span class="pagenum">[195]</span> being sodainly stricken, his fingers ends being
   cut off, and part of the arteries, he fell downe; but yet he died
   not, till being mangled with eight strokes in the necke, and in
   the heade, he fulfilled most worthy martyrdome."</p>

<p class="author1">Stow's <i>Annales</i>, p. 458.</p>

<p>Thus "barbarously" was the prelate murdered; the rebels then took his
head, fastened it "on a pole, and set it on London bridge, in place
where-before stood the head of Sir <i>John</i> Minstarworth." (<i>Ibid.</i>) Stow
proceeds to relate some more particulars relative to the archbishop's
history, stating that "he builded the upper end," that is, I conceive,
the chancel "of <i>St. Gregorie's</i> Church at Sudbury;" and concludes his
account by saying:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "He was slaine as ye haue heard, and afterwards buried in the
   Cathedral Church of Canterbury."</p>

<p class="author1"><i>Ibid.</i></p>


<p>Now Godwin, in his valuable work <i>De Presulibus</i>, states, that his body
was buried under the high altar of St. Dunstan's, Canterbury. But in
Winkle's <i>Cathedrals</i> (London, 1836), vol. i. p. 38., we find Stow's
account corroborated; for&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "The monument of Archbishop Sudbury, who was beheaded in 1381
   [1382], is in the northern aisle, nearly parallel with the altar;
   it bears no effigy, but is surmounted by a sumptuous canopy of
   very elegant architectural design, but now much mutilated."</p>

<p class="noindent">Of course, the fact that his monument is in the cathedral, does not
<i>prove</i> that his body was buried there. I shall be glad to learn from
any of your correspondents, what evidence there is for Godwin's
assertion. Gostling, in his <i>Walk in and about the City of Canterbury</i>
(5th edit. Cant. 1804), though he mentions the prelate's benefactions to
the cathedral (pp. 12. 79.), and his tomb (p. 220.), does not state his
place of sepulture. At p. 60., however (note &#8225;), in a brief notice of
St. Dunstan's Church, he says:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "In a vault under the family chancel of Roper <i>here</i> is kept a
   skull, said to be that of the great Sir Thomas More; it is in a
   niche of the wall, secured with an iron grate, though some say
   his favourite daughter, Margaret Roper, who lies here, desired to
   be buried with it in her arms. The vault being full, was closed
   up not many years since."</p>

<p class="noindent">This curious coincidence is at least worth noting.</p>

<p>I trust that the interest necessarily attaching to any remains of so
celebrated an historical personage, will prove a sufficient apology to
your readers for the length of this note.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Suffolk Legend.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In the little village of Acton, Suffolk, a legend was
current not many years ago, that on certain occasions, which, by the
way, were never accurately defined, the park gates were<a id="Page_196"></a> <span class="pagenum">[196]</span> wont to
fly open at midnight "withouten hands," and a carriage drawn by four
spectral horses, and accompanied by headless grooms and outriders,
proceeded with great rapidity from the park to a spot called "the
nursery corner." What became of the ghostly <i>cortège</i> at this spot, I
have never been able to learn; but though the sight has not been seen by
any of the present inhabitants, yet some of them have heard the noise of
the head-long race. The "Corner," tradition says, is the spot where a
very bloody engagement took place in olden time, when the Romans were
governors of England. A few coins have I believe been found, but nothing
else confirmatory of the tale. Does history in any way support the story
of the battle? Whilst writing on this subject, I may as well note, that
near this haunted corner is a pool called Wimbell Pond, in which
tradition says an iron chest of money is concealed: if any daring person
ventures to approach the pond, and throw a stone into the water, it will
ring against the chest and a small white figure has been heard to cry in
accents of distress, "That's mine!"</p>

<p>I send you these legends as I have heard them from the lips of my nurse,
a native of the village.</p>

<span><i>Theodoric, Legend of.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;May we not consider the Saxon legend quoted by
Mr. Kemble in his <i>Saxons in England</i>, foot-note on page 423., vol. i.,
as something like a parallel to "Old Booty" and Mr. Gresham, mentioned
in Vol. iii., p. 93. of "N. &amp; Q.?" or is it possible to have been the
origin of both?</p>

<p>The legend is, that an anchoret in Lipari told some sailors that at a
particular time he had seen King Theodoric ungirt, barefoot and bound,
led between St. John, pope and martyr, and St. Finian, and by them
hurled into the burning crater of the neighbouring island volcano. That
on the sailors' return to Italy they discovered, by comparison of dates,
that Theodoric died on the day on which the anchoret noticed his
punishment by the hands of his victims.</p>

<p>Every reader of "N. &amp; Q." must be acquainted with places throughout the
country pronounced very differently to their spelling. It has occurred
to me that a collection of them would be interesting, both as a
topographical curiosity, and as an illustration of our provincial
dialects. No paper is fitter for such a collection than the "N. &amp; Q.;"
its correspondents would doubtless communicate any within their notice,
and you, Mr. Editor, would from time to time give up a little space to
them.</p>

<p>Some of your correspondents may send Scotch, Irish, and Welsh specimens;
I would suggest such be kept separate from the English. My own
experience bids me carefully abstain from sending Welsh ones. When on a
walking tour in Wales three years ago, I asked a peasant "if that road
led to <i>Aberga'ny</i>" (with conscious pride in my pronunciation); "Nay,
nay, sir, <i>that</i> road takes to Abergavenny."</p>

<p>&mdash;The Banking

Note respecting it may be new to many of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." This
Company adopted the plan of using paper bearing in watermark a waved
line, and the amount of the note expressed in words, along with the
designation of the Company; but about the year 1805 a gentleman
connected with Aberdeenshire brought this paper under the notice of the
Bank of England, in consequence of which they adopted it, and procured
an act of parliament to be passed prohibiting the use of paper so marked
by any provincial bank.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Which are the Shadows?</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In the notes to the beautiful poem <i>Italy</i>, by
Samuel Rogers, published (I think) in 1830, the following occurs:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "'You admire that picture,' said an old Dominican to me at Padua,
   as I stood contemplating a Last Supper in the refectory of his
   convent, the figures as large as life. 'I have sat at my meals
   before it for seven-and-forty years and such are the changes that
   have taken place among us; so many have come and gone in the
   time, that when I look upon the company there&mdash;upon those who are
   sitting at the table silent as they&mdash;I am sometimes inclined to
   think that we, and not they, are the shadows.'"</p>

<p>In the sixth volume of Lord Mahon's <i>History of England</i>, chap. lx. p.
498., we find this passage:<a id="Page_197"></a> <span class="pagenum">[197]</span></p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "Once as Sir David Wilkie (Mr. Washington Irving and myself being
   then his fellow-travellers in Spain) was gazing on one of
   Titian's master-pieces&mdash;the famous picture of the Last Supper in
   the refectory of the Escurial&mdash;an old monk of the order of St.
   Jerome came up, and said to him, 'I have sat daily in sight of
   that picture for now nearly three score years. During that time
   my companions have dropped off, one after another&mdash;all who were
   my seniors, all who were of mine own age, and many or most of
   those who were younger than myself; nothing has been unchanged
   around me except those figures, large as life, in yonder
   painting; and I look at them till I sometimes think that they are
   the realities, and we the shadows.'"</p>

<p>The great resemblance between these two passages is very striking; the
latter only amplifies the former by very few words.</p>

<span><i>Antiquity of County Boundaries.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In the loop of Devonshire, on the
western side of the Tamar, formed by the parishes of Werrington and
North Petherwyn, none of the names of places are Cornish, but end in the
Saxon termination of <i>cot</i>, whilst in all other parts the Cornish names
are used up to the banks of the river. Modern Cornwall is a province so
well defined by the language of its place-names, that it could be marked
off without difficulty, if its artificial boundary-lines were omitted on
a map. How does this limited extent of the language consist with some
accounts of the former extent of the kingdom?</p>

(afterwards Bishop) Pearce was prior to the death<a id="death2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the famous
Master of Westminster, which took place at the <i>short</i> interval of five
years: consequently, it was impossible that the relation of teacher and
pupil should exist between them.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#death2" class="label">[2]</a> 1695.</p>

<p>In the Memoir of this prelate, which goes before his <i>Commentary on the
Gospels</i>, it is expressly stated that he was removed to Westminster
School in Feb. 1704. At the same time, his biographer speaks of his
being elected to Trinity College, Cambridge, after he had spent six
years at Westminster, and "endured the constraint of a grammar school to
the twentieth year of his age." Then follows the sentence, "Why his
removal was so long delayed, no other reason can be given, than that Dr.
Busby used to detain those boys longest under his discipline of whose
future eminence he had most expectation; considering the fundamental
knowledge which grammar schools inculcate, as that which is least likely
to be supplied by future diligence, if the student be sent deficient to
the university."</p>

<p>Bishop Pearce's biographer was the Rev. John Derby, his chaplain, who
could not well be mistaken as to a plain and palpable matter of fact. It
is perfectly conceivable, however, that the future prelate was long
detained at Westminster School in consequence of a regulation <i>first</i>
laid down by Busby, and regularly acted upon by that eminent man. This
circumstance will sufficiently explain the apparent incongruity.</p>

<h3>
<span>THOMAS BASTARD, AND SONG AGAINST SHEEP-FARMING.</span>
</h3>


<p>The twentieth epigram in the fourth book of <i>Chrestoleros</i>, by T. B.
(poor Thomas Bastard), printed 1598, is to the following effect:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Sheepe have eate up our medows and our downes,</p>
     <p> Our corne, our wood, whole villages and townes.</p>
    <p>  Yea, they have eate up many wealthy men,</p>
      <p>Besides widowes, and orphane childeren:</p>
   <p>   Besides our statutes and our iron lawes,</p>
     <p> Which they have swallowed down into their maws.</p>
      <p>Till now I thought the proverbe did but jest,</p>
  <p>    Which said a blacke sheepe was a biting beast."</p>

</div>

<p>Here the allusion is of course to the miseries entailed by the system of
sheep-farming; a system which had been introduced and carried to excess
by the monastic bodies. Some years ago I met with an old satirical song
on this subject, of which the above "proverbe" formed a kind of burden,
but where, or in what collection I met with it, I cannot for the life of
me remember. Now, seeing that your periodical exemplifies very
accurately the definition once given by a Surrey peasant of a highly
accomplished man&mdash;"Sir! he knows everything, and what he don't know he
axes,"&mdash;perhaps you will allow me to ask whether some one of your many
able correspondents may not have the power and the will to give me this
information. A worthless memory seems to suggest that the song was a
Cambridge production, and interspersed with Latin phrases.</p>

<p>Now, one word about the author of the epigram above quoted. It is not, I
hope, an abuse of the freedom of speech which ought to prevail in the
republic of letters, if I express a strong opinion<a id="Page_198"></a> <span class="pagenum">[198]</span> that your
learned contributor, M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. P<span class="smcap lowercase">AYNE</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER</span>, has rendered very scant justice
to the memory of Bastard. The epigrams selected by that gentleman as
favourable samples, are among the very worst of the author's efforts.</p>

<p>Probably not twenty copies of the <i>Chrestoleros</i> are in existence; but
as, by the kindness of my esteemed friend E. V. Utterson, I possess one
of the sixteen struck off at his own private press, I beg to supply a
specimen or two, that will not only gratify your readers in general, but
elicit an approving verdict from M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER</span> himself.</p>

<p>For example, is not the finished cadence, as well as the nervous force,
of the following lines to Sir Ph. Sidney, greatly to be admired?</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p class="noindent"> "When Nature wrought upon her mould so well,</p>
      <p>  That Nature wondred her own work to see,</p>

        <p>And both had spent their excellence in thee;</p>
 <p class="noindent"> Willing they gave thee into Fortune's hand,</p>
     <p> Fearing they could not end what they beganne!"</p>

</div>

<p>In my poor judgment, those are truly noble lines. And what say you to
the following, Mr. Editor, which form a sonnet rather than an epigram?</p>

<div class="poem">

       <p class="noindent">"The world's great peers and mighty conquerours,</p>

</div>

<p>I not only challenge M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. P. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLIER'S</span> hearty approval of those
magnificent lines, but I would venture the expression of a doubt whether
anything finer can be produced of the same date and character.</p>

<p>Now take a spice of Bastard's quality as a humorist; not failing to mark
again the solemn flow and well-balanced cadence of the lines:</p>

<p>I have other evidence as strongly favourable, but I shall not adduce it,
lest after all it be wasted on unwilling ears. But if it be the verdict
of your readers that Thomas Bastard has been unjustly forgotten, he
shall live again in your pages.</p>

<h3>
<span>INUNDATIONS AND THEIR PHENOMENA.</span>
</h3>

<p>The remarkable inundations that have recently taken place (I do not, of
course, allude to the accident at Holmesfirth) in various parts of the
country, without any such very long-continued and violent storms of rain
as one would naturally look to as their cause, have called to my
recollection some remarks in the "Notices Scientifiques" of M. Arago,
attached to the <i>Annuaire pour l'An 1838</i>, published by the Bureau des
Longitudes at Paris. I beg to transcribe them:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"Des historiens, les météorologistes citent des inondations
   locales dont les effets ont semblé bien supérieures à ce que
   pouvoit faire craindre la médiocre quantité de pluie provenante
   des nuages et tombée dans un certain rayon. Il est rarement
   arrivé qu'alors <i>on n'ait pas vu</i>, pendant un temps plus ou moins
   long, d'immense masses d'eau surgir des entrailles de la terre
   par des ouvertures jusque là inconnues, et aussi, <i>qu'un violent
   orage n'ait pas été la précurseur du phénomène et probablement sa
   cause première</i>. Telles furent, du point en point, par example,
   en juin, 1686, les circonstances de l'inondation qui détruisit
   presque en totalité les deux villages de <i>Ketlevell</i> et de
   <i>Starbottom</i>, dans le comté d'York. Pendant l'orage une immense
   crevasse se forma dans la montagne voisine, et, au dire des
   témoins oculaires, la masse fluide qui s'en échappa avec
   impétuosité contribua au moins tout autant que la pluie, aux
   malheurs qu'on eut à déplores."&mdash;P. 361.</p>

<p>1. Is there any reason to suppose that a subterranean outburst of this
nature accompanied any of the recent inundations?</p>

<p>2. Does the "immense crevice" alluded to by M. Arago still exist? and
does water continue to proceed from it?</p>

<h3>
<span>A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL QUERY.</span>
</h3>

<p>In the year 1704 was published anonymously:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "<i>An Essay towards a Proposal for Catholic Communion</i>; wherein
   above sixty of the principal controverted points, which have
   hitherto divided Christendom, being called over, 'tis examined
   how many of them may, and ought to be laid aside, and how few
   remain to be accommodated, for the effecting a general Peace. By
   a Minister of the Church of England. Sold by John Nutt, near
   Stationers' Hall, 1704."</p>

<p>This <i>Essay</i> has passed through several editions in London and Dublin:
to that of 1801 is prefixed a</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"Dedication to the Right Hon. the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
   and to the Hon. the House of Commons ... and the perusal of it
   earnestly recommended by a Lover of Christian Peace and Union and
   a Loyal United Briton."<a id="Page_199"></a> <span class="pagenum">[199]</span></p>

<p>It has now been in circulation for nearly a century and a half; and for
want of a medium of inter-communication in olden times like "N. &amp; Q.,"
its authorship has frequently been a topic of keen discussion. Mr.
Oakeley, in his work, <i>The Subject of Tract XC. historically examined</i>,
states that</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Its publication attracted at the time the notice of the
   Government. A warrant appears to have been issued from the
   Secretary of State's office for the seizure of the author's
   papers, and the arrest of his person, under a suspicion
   apparently that he was in league with the Pretender."</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that Mr. Oakeley has not given his authority for
this statement. Mr. Goode, in his pamphlet entitled <i>Tract XC.
historically refuted</i>, attributes it, on the authority of Dodd, to
Thomas Dean, a Roman Catholic Fellow of University College, Oxford;
whereas the author of <i>The Sure Hope of Reconciliation</i>, p. 61., thinks
Mr. Goode's supposition open to exception; and as the writer styles
himself "A Minister of the Church of England," he is inclined to admit
his claim to the title, till stronger evidence be adduced to the
contrary.</p>

<p>The following curious colloquy between two priests of the Roman and
Anglican Churches, in the Town Hall at Guildford, in 1838, respecting
the authorship of this <i>Essay</i>, is also worthy a Note:</p>

  <p class="indh"> "<i>Rev. Joseph Sidden.</i> The author of <i>A Proposal for a Catholic
   Communion</i> says&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p class="indh"> "<i>Rev. M. Hobart Seymour.</i> Name! name.</p>

  <p class="indh">"<i>Rev. J. Sidden.</i> I do not know his name; he appears to have
   been an archdeacon of the Church of England in the reign of Queen
   Anne. His work is on sale at Booker's.</p>

  <p class="indh"> "<i>The Chairman.</i> Can you name the place of which he was
   archdeacon?</p>

  <p class="indh"> "<i>Rev. J. Sidden.</i> No; but I give these as the words of a
   Protestant clergyman.</p>

  <p class="indh">"<i>Rev. M. H. Seymour.</i> You do not know that he was a Protestant
   at all.</p>

  <p class="indh"> "<i>Rev. J. Sidden.</i> I have put the work into the hands of a
   Protestant clergyman, who agrees with it; and it agrees with
   Archbishop Bramhall. I have often tried to discover who was the
   author.</p>

  <p class="indh"> "<i>Rev. M. H. Seymour.</i> It was written perhaps by a Roman Catholic
   Priest.</p>

  <p class="indh"> "<i>Rev. J. Sidden.</i> I think not, because the Hon. and Rev. Arthur
   Perceval, rector of East Horsley, borrowed the book of me, and he
   wrote to me, that he so much approved of it, that he meant to
   procure a copy of it. I do not know who wrote it."&mdash;<i>Proceedings
   at a Meeting of the Guildford Protestant Association</i>, 1838, p.
   20.</p>

<p>Now, without discussing the theological points at issue between the two
parties, it is desirable that the authorship of this work, as a literary
production, should be finally settled, which I am inclined to think will
be the case when it is brought before the numerous readers of "N. &amp; Q."
On its first appearance it was attacked by three Nonjuring clergymen,
viz. Grascome, Stephens, and Spinckes. Grascome, it appears, knew the
author; but his work, <i>Concordia Discors</i>, I have not been able to
procure. (See <i>Life of Kettlewell</i>, p. 328.) It is not to be found in
the catalogues of the Bodleian, British Museum, or Sion College. The
replies by Edward Stephens and Nathanael Spinckes are both in the
Bodleian. The first edition of the original <i>Essay</i>, 1704, is in the
British Museum, and on the title-page is written in pencil, "By Thomas
Dean, a papist," and underneath, in ink, "By Nathanael Spinckes, not a
Roman Catholic." The latter entry is clearly a mistake.</p>

<p>After some investigation, it appears to me that the authorship rests
between Thomas Dean and Joshua Bassett. It is attributed to the former
by Dodd (<i>alias</i> Tootle) in his <i>Certamen utriusqe Ecclesiæ</i>; but Wood,
who has given some account of Dean in his <i>Athenæ Oxon.</i>, vol. iv. p.
450. (Bliss), does not include this <i>Essay</i> among his other works. In
the Bodleian Catalogue its authorship is attributed to Joshua Bassett,
Master of Sidney College, Cambridge, of whom our biographical
dictionaries are perfectly silent. Fortunately, Cole has preserved some
notices of him in his MSS., vol. xx. p. 117. It appears that he was a
Roman Catholic, and had mass publicly said in his college; but upon King
James revoking the mandamuses in 1688, he left Cambridge and settled in
London, where, says Cole, "he lived to be a very old man, and died in no
very affluent circumstances, as we may well imagine." Cole notices a
work by Bassett published anonymously, viz. <i>Reason and Authority; or
the Motives of a late Protestant's Reconciliation to the Catholic
Church</i>. London: 1687, 4to. With this clue, probably, some of your
readers can finally settle the question.</p>

<h3>
<span>NEW ARRANGEMENT OF THE OLD TESTAMENT.</span>
</h3>

<p>I am engaged in preparing the Old Testament on the same plan, but with
some alterations and additions, as the <i>Chronological New Testament</i>
described in Vol. iv., p. 357.</p>

<p>I write to ask if any of your correspondents can aid me in my
undertaking in the following points:</p>

<p>I. To inform me where I can procure, by purchase, or by loan for a few
weeks, Torshell's tract or book, in which he proposed to Charles I. to
undertake such a work.</p>

<p>II. To make a re-division, according to the subject-matter, of Job,
Ecclesiastes, and the greater and the minor prophets.</p>

<p>III. To draw up a brief analysis of this subject-matter, similar to what
is attempted in the New Testament for the Epistles.<a id="Page_200"></a> <span class="pagenum">[200]</span></p>

<p>IV. To extract from the Mishneh, &amp;c., the <i>really</i> valuable comments of
the rabbis.</p>

<p>V. To make up the chronology into the following four great unequal
divisions, assigning the particular years to each transaction falling
under these divisions; viz., (a) Adam to Abraham, (b) Abraham to David;
(c) David to the transportation of Judah to Babylon; (d) Transportation
to Babylon to Christ.</p>

<p>VI. To collate all these <i>important</i> variations of the Septuagint and of
the Samaritan Pentateuch.</p>

<p>VII. Critically to examine the introductions, marginal quotations, and
the analyses, as given in the <i>Chronological New Testament</i>.</p>

<p>I shall with pleasure present any gentleman who will help me in any one
of these particulars with a copy of the New Testament at once, if he
will signify his wish for one, in a line addressed to me, care of the
Publisher, Mr. Blackader, 13. Paternoster Row.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Meaning of "Knarres."</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In a minister's account of the time of Edward
II., relating to Caernarvonshire, is an entry for rent received "de
terra morosa et knarres:" the word is sometimes written <i>gnarres</i>. What
does it mean? I believe in Norfolk and in other counties a description
of scrubby woodland is known by the name of <i>carrs</i> (Query spelling). We
find <i>Knares</i>-borough in Yorkshire, and <i>Knares</i>-dale in Northumberland,
<i>Nar</i>-borough in Leicester, <i>Nar</i>-burgh and <i>Nar</i>-ford in Norfolk.
Taking the <i>n</i> to be the expressive letter, we have perhaps specimens of
its softened sound in the names of <i>Snare</i>-hill, <i>Snar</i>-gate,
<i>Snares</i>-brook, &amp;c., in various counties. Some of your etymological
readers may be able to explain the derivation of these names, should
they be considered to come from a common source, and with that the
sentence quoted above.</p>

recantation took place in the year 1556, and his death, from a broken
heart, in the year following; so that his being compelled to sit on the
bench beside Bonner, must have been at the trials which took place
between those two dates. I have Foxe, Fuller, and Strype's memoirs of
Sir John Cheke; but I shall be grateful for any information about him
from any other old volumes, or from private sources.</p>

annual visit from the minor officials of the inn, beadle, porter, &amp;c.,
who presented four oranges, and received in return half a guinea. I used
generally to suck the oranges, but it never entered my head to inquire
what was the origin of the custom. You have probably a correspondent or

Queen Elizabeth is mentioned as of a "<i>swarthy</i> complexion." I had
always thought of her as fair. Miss Strickland speaks of her "<i>fair</i>
complexion," and cites De Maurier, who writes of her "<i>white</i> hands:" in
addition to which, does not her "light auburn hair" betoken a light
complexion? In one of your late numbers a madrigal is given wherein she
is sung as "<i>fair</i> Oriana." This, however, may be no allusion to colour
of complexion, but merely the poetic use of the word as synonymous with
beautiful. How does the fact stand?</p>

<span>LIBER CONFORMITATUM.<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 321.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Bartholomæo degli Albizzi, or Bartholomew of Pisa, who wrote the famous
B<span class="smcap lowercase">OOK OF</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ONFORMITIES</span>, was born at Rivano in Tuscany, and died in 1401.
Mr. Rose's admirable <i>Biographical Dict.</i> (12 vols. 8vo. 1850) contains
the following passage relative to this work, under the name
 Albizzi:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "The L<span class="smcap lowercase">IBER</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ONFORMITATUM</span> <i>was first printed at Venice, folio,
   without date or printer's name</i>; 2nd edition, folio, black
   letter, Milan, 1510; 3rd, Milan, 1513. In 1590, Father Bucchi (a
   Franciscan) published another edition at <i>Bologna</i>, but with
   considerable curtailment; and as it did not sell, it was
   republished in 1620 <i>with the first two leaves changed</i>, in order
   to disguise it.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "The approbation of the Chapter of the Order is found in this
   edition, bearing date Aug. 2, 1399. Tiraboschi (i. 181.), who is
   very angry with M<span class="smcap lowercase">ARCHAND</span>
 for occupying S<span class="smcap lowercase">IXTEEN</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLUMNS OF THE</span>
   D<span class="smcap lowercase">ICT</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">IST</span>. W<span class="smcap lowercase">ITH AN</span> E<span class="smcap lowercase">NUMERATION OF THE</span> E<span class="smcap lowercase">DITIONS OF THIS</span> W<span class="smcap lowercase">ORK AND</span>
   A<span class="smcap lowercase">NSWERS TO IT</span>, should have remembered that after such an
   approbation, it is no longer the mere work of an individual.</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "In 1632, it was published at <i>Cologne</i> with a new title; and in
   1658 at <i>Liege</i>, but very much altered. Wading (<i>Bibl. Ord.
   Min.</i>) has given a catalogue of Albizzi's other works, which has
   been copied by Casimir, Oudin, and Fabricius."</p>

<p>A Venice edition, then, it would appear according to this writer, is the
<i>original edition</i>; and that of Milan, 1510, is but the <i>second</i>. Will
any one give me some accurate information on this point? Brunet and the
publishers of the various editions of "L'Alcoran," seem quite ignorant
of the existence of any edition previous to that of Milan, 1510.</p>

<p>D<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. E<span class="smcap lowercase">RASMUS</span> A<span class="smcap lowercase">LBER</span>, the compiler of the <i>Alcoranus Franciscorum</i>, was "a
warm friend and violent partizan of Luther; his chief characteristic is
severe, but broad, coarse satire."</p>

<p>The Amsterdam edition of 1734 commences the 1st vol. with a preface in
French, by Conrad Badius, which is succeeded by one from Luther in
Latin: at the end of the same vol. occurs another and longer <i>Præfatio
Martini Lutheri, Germanico libello præfixa utcumque translata</i>; then
follow <i>Typographus Lectori</i>, and <i>Ex Epistola Erasmi Alberi, qui hunc
libellum ex detestando illo Conformitatum volumine contexuit</i>.</p>

<p>To any one who is acquainted with the <i>Book of Conformities</i>, which has
been justly denominated T<span class="smcap lowercase">HESAURUS</span> B<span class="smcap lowercase">LASPHEMIÆ</span>, the propriety and aptness
of the title of T<span class="smcap lowercase">HE</span> F<span class="smcap lowercase">RANCISCAN</span> K<span class="smcap lowercase">ORAN</span> is very obvious. Luther (and there
seems no reason to doubt the genuineness of these prefaces), after
commenting on the expressions used in this book with reference to our
Blessed Lord, and the great exemplar of the "minors" and "minims,"
observes:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"<i>Hinc sequitur quod Christus veluti figura Francisci, nihil fit
   amplius: id</i> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UOD</span> T<span class="smcap lowercase">URCI</span> S<span class="smcap lowercase">ENTIUNT</span>. <i>At figuratus ille Franciscus,
   omnia est in omnibus. Ex quo jam altera hæresis manat, quod
   Franciscum, ut verum Messiam, Mediatorem, Advocatum ac Patronum
   invocunt, et vitam æternam ab ipso petunt.</i>"</p>

<p>A<span class="smcap lowercase">LBER</span>, after quoting some of the <i>Conformities</i>, adds&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "<i>Et, ut paucis dicam, Christus nihil fecit quod non item
   Franciscus fecerit, et longe plura etiam. Itaque et in Alcorano
   Franciscanorum sæpe reperitur, Franciscum Christo esse</i>
S<span class="smcap lowercase">IMILEM</span>.
   <i>Nam quod sit</i> S<span class="smcap lowercase">UPRA</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">HRISTUM</span>, <i>perquam vellent quidem dicere,
   sed diabolis metuit ne nimium se prodat et agnosci possit.</i>"</p>

<p>The mere facts of this monstrous book having been <i>written</i>, <i>approved</i>
by the highest authority, and for a <i>century and a half</i> receiving
universal applause (with the exception perhaps of a few jealous
Dominicans), nay, the mere <i>toleration</i> of such a book, would have been
amply sufficient to show the corruption of the Western Church, and call
loudly for reformation. This&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">   "<i>Abominationem</i> [says Luther] <i>quam non ipsi solum exercuerunt
   ac in summo pretio habuerunt, sed ipse etiam Sanctissimus eam
   confirmavit, commendavit, privilegiis ornavit, ac omnibus Christe
   fidelibus pro focis et aris defendendam mandavit.</i>"</p>

<p>Southey says:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "I believe the Franciscans designed to follow the example of the
   Moslem, and supersede Jesus Christ. At one time they attempted to
   leave off the vulgar æra, and actually dated from the infliction
   of the Five Wounds."</p>

<p>In the Romish calendar, the 17th of September is dedicated to "Impressio
Stigm. S. Francis." Of the Geneva editions of the Cordelier Alcoran,
Brunet (last edition) mentions 1556, 1560, and 1578. In Leslie's
Catalogue for 1852, under the heading "<i>Luther</i>," the Geneva edition of
1556 occurs; the title is worth giving:<a id="Page_203"></a> <span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "L'Alcoran des Cordeliers, tant en Latin qu'en François; c'est à
   dire, la mer des blasphèmes et mensonges de cest idole stigmatizé
   qu'on appelle S. François, recueilli par le Docteur M. Luther, du
   livre des Conformitez de ce beau S. François, imprimé à Milan
   l'an 1510, et nouvellement traduit, 12mo. Geneve, 1556."</p>

<p>The same Catalogue advertises a fine copy of Father Bucchi's <i>Liber
Aureus</i>, 1590.</p>

<p>Brunet refers to the following work in reference to the <i>Alcoranus</i>:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "La Guerre Séraphique, ou histoire des périls qu'a courus la
   barbe des Capucins contre les violentes attaques des Cordeliers.
   La Haye, 1740, in 12.&mdash;<i>Ce volume se joint à l'Alcoran des
   Cordeliers.</i>"</p>

<p>He also speaks of a work by a certain Spaniard, named Father
 P<span class="smcap lowercase">IERRE DE</span>
 A<span class="smcap lowercase">LVA</span>, which, for the vast number of points of <i>conformity</i> between our
Lord and St. Francis adduced, and the amazing fecundity of invention and
fertility of imagination displayed, completely throws

<p>To conclude with a Query: Is the book called "F<span class="smcap lowercase">IORETTI</span>" an Italian
translation of the "B<span class="smcap lowercase">OOK OF</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ONFORMITIES</span>?" The title would lead one to

<h3>
<span>TRADITIONS OF REMOTE PERIODS.&mdash;GEORGE III.'S GARTER.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 77. 135.) </span>
</h3>

<p>There is clearly some inaccuracy in the details of my statement, which I
am obliged to L<span class="smcap lowercase">ORD</span> B<span class="smcap lowercase">RAYBROOKE</span> and to G. for pointing out, and which,
perhaps, they may help to clear up. The main fact is admitted: that
"<i>two</i> Knights of the Garter covered the period from 1684 to 1820;" and
George IV.'s assertion, that "he had given away a Garter that had been
given but once since the reign of Charles II.," I myself heard, though I
unluckily did not make a "Note" of it. This could apply to nothing but
the cases of the Duke of Somerset and George III. Whether George IV. was
misinformed as to the details on which he founded his assertion, I know
not; but it is unlikely: and that after a lapse of about thirty years I
may have confounded the <i>Regency</i> with the <i>Accession</i>, and <i>Lord Moira</i>
with the <i>Duke of Buckingham</i>, I will not deny; for it seems that I have
done one or the other, though without any effect on the main point. As
to G.'s objection, that of several Garters disposed of on the same day
in 1745. The Duke of Somerset's did not fall to Prince George. I have
not Beltz to refer to; but it strikes me as possible this may admit of
explanation: because, although Prince George was <i>nominated</i> first in
the batch, it happened that he was <i>invested</i> the last; indeed not till
the day <i>after</i> all the others: so that he might have received the
<i>badge</i> of the Duke of Somerset. Your readers are aware that the
<i>badges</i> are not the private property of the knights, but are always
<i>returned</i> into the hands of the <i>sovereign</i>, and that the same badge is
delivered to successive knights; so that it is probable that George
III., on becoming sovereign, kept in his own possession the badge he had
originally received, and that this identical badge George IV. disposed
of as he stated, whether to the Duke of Buckingham, or, as the
impression on my memory still is, Lord Moira.</p>

<p><i>Traditions from Remote Periods.</i>&mdash;From time to time notices have
appeared in "N. &amp; Q." of "remote events brought down to our own times
through few links:" to these, if you should think it merits insertion, I
beg to contribute the following Note from Chambers's <i>Life and Works of
Burns</i>, vol. iii. p. 205. In the address to Mr. Maxwell, of Terraughty,
on his birthday (p. 204.), Burns says, 7th line:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"This day<a id="day4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> thou
 metes threescore eleven,"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and Mr. Chambers remarks:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"The person addressed in these verses, John Maxwell, Esq., of
   Terraughty and Munches, was a leading public man in the county of
   Dumfries. He was on several accounts very remarkable, but
   particularly for his birth, and the proximity into which his
   family history brings us with events comparatively remote; for
   Mr. Maxwell was grandson's grandson, and no more, to the gallant
   and faithful Lord Herries, who on bended knees entreated Queen
   Mary to prosecute Bothwell as the murderer of her husband, and
   who subsequently fought for her at Langside. One cannot learn
   without a pleasing kind of surprise, that a relation in the fifth
   degree of one who was <i>Warden of the West Marches in 1545</i>,
   should have lived to the close of the French Revolution wars,
   which was the case of Mr. Maxwell, for he died in <i>January
   1814</i>."</p>

   and so in due time continued in such births till, through
   bearing, she became impotent. The certainty of this relation I
   had from John Delavall of Northumb', Esq., who, ann. 1630, rid
   about 30 miles beyond Edenburrough to see this fruitfull couple,

<h3>
<span>PEDIGREE OF RICHARD EARL OF CHEPSTOW.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 126.)</span>
</h3>

<p>It seems there can be no doubt that Richard de Clare, second Earl of
Pembroke, surnamed<a id="Page_205"></a> <span class="pagenum">[205]</span> Strongbow, was eldest son of Gilbert de Clare,
first Earl of Pembroke: which last was second son of Gilbert de
Tonebrugge. That Strongbow's father's name was Gilbert is proved from a
charter in which he (the father) made a grant of the church of Everton
to the priory of St. Neot, commencing "Gilbertus, filius G. Comes de
Penbroc," &amp;c. (See <i>Dugdale</i>.) And I find this confirmed by a valuable
old pedigree in the possession of a member of my family (date <i>cir.</i>
1620), which was admitted as principal evidence, and examined, in a
successful suit in the Court of Chancery, in the latter half of the last
century; in which pedigree the De Clares are introduced among the
"præclarissimæ affinitates." An extract would be needless, and occupy
your valuable space to no purpose.</p>

<p>To account for the singularity mentioned by your correspondent in the
charter of Strongbow, I can make but these two suggestions: either the
reading is correct,&mdash;in which case the true name of the first Earl of
Pembroke was <i>Richard Gilbert</i>, which, I need hardly say, is possible,
notwithstanding the existence of his elder brother Richard; or, the
reading is incorrect, in which case the mistake probably arose from the
writer, notwithstanding he had written "Comes Ric'" previously, by a
natural oversight inserting it again after "fil," intending to write,
"Comes Ric' fil Gisleb'ti."</p>

<p>It may be an admission of ignorance on my part, but I am unable to find
in any of the authorities I have at hand, that Strongbow, Earl of
Pembroke, was, as your correspondent states him to have been, also <i>Earl
of Chepstow</i>. Will he be kind enough to give me a reference?</p>

<p>In the above-mentioned pedigree the arms of the De Clares are given down
to Strongbow&mdash;<i>or, three chevrons gules</i>; while the bearing of the
latter is <i>or, five chevrons gules</i>. Burke, in his <i>Extinct Peerage</i>,
gives the arms of both the De Clares, Earls of Pembroke, <i>or three
chevrons gules, a lable of five points az.</i>; while in another authority,
Berry's <i>Encycl.</i>, I find for the two De Clares, Earls of Pembroke, two
widely different coats, viz. <i>ar. on a chief az. three crosses pattée
fitchée of the field</i>; and <i>or, three chevrons gules, a crescent az.</i>
Can any of your heraldic correspondents account for these various
bearings?</p>

<h3>
<span>ISABEL, QUEEN OF THE ISLE OF MAN.
(Vol. v., p. 132.)</span>
</h3>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. W<span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">IDNEY</span> G<span class="smcap lowercase">IBSON</span> has correctly referred to the authority for this
designation; but it may be well, before pursuing the inquiry, to place
before the reader the very words of the register of the Grey Friars of
London:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"Versus quasi medium chori jacet dominus Willelmus Fitzwarryn
   Baro, et Isabella uxor sua quondam Regina Man."</p>

<p class="author1"><i>Collectanea Top. et Geneal.</i> v. 278.</p>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. G<span class="smcap lowercase">IBSON</span> has also correctly added, that in my note to this entry I
have not afforded any information about the lady Isabel. It is true that
I searched for such information in vain; and the information I gave in
lieu was the date of the death of William Lord Fitz-Warine, viz., the 35
Edw. III. (1361), and the name of the lady he is known from record (Ex.
22 Edw. III. no. 39.), to have married, namely, <i>Amicia</i>, daughter and
heir of Sir Henry de Haddon. As there is not the slightest ground for
imagining that this Amicia was ever "Queen of Man," it must therefore be
concluded, supposing that the register of the Grey Friars gives a
faithful reflection of the epitaph, that the Lord Fitz-Warine had a
second wife. I am not inclined to adopt M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. G<span class="smcap lowercase">IBSON'S</span> suggestion that
this lady was <i>Sibilla</i>, daughter of William de Montacute, first Earl of
Salisbury, because the lordship of Man descended to the second earl, and
he possessed it until the 16 Ric. II. (1393). It seems therefore that
the only "Queen of Man" that could be the wife of William Lord
Fitz-Warine, must have been the widow of the first Earl of Salisbury,
who died in 1343. The wife of that earl and the mother of his heir was
<i>Katharine</i>, daughter of William Lord Granson, as Mr. Beltz gives that
name, correcting the more prevalent form of Grandison. The question
therefore to be decided is&mdash;Did this lady survive him, or did he marry a
second wife named <i>Isabella</i>? In either case, I think it is clear that
the lady buried at the Grey Friars was the Dowager Countess of
Salisbury. Mr. Beltz has given a memoir of Sir William Fitz-Warine in
his <i>Memorials of the Garter</i>, but he was not aware of the baron's
connexion with "the Queen of Man." Dying of the plague on the 28th Oct.
1361, it was probably in haste that his body was interred in the church
of the Grey Friars, and the queen may have fallen a victim to the same
pestilence. There is an effigy in the church at Wantage which is
ascribed to this Lord Fitz-Warine; and it is accompanied by one of a
lady, probably Amicia Haddon, on whose death, some time before his own,
that monument may have been erected. These effigies are engraved in the
series by Hollis. There is a peculiarity attending the barony of this
William Fitz-Warine. He was first summoned by writ in 1342 [qu. if 1343,
and thus after his marriage with the Dowager Countess of Salisbury?];
and though he left a son and heir, Sir Ivo Fitz-Warine, that son was
never summoned to parliament. A similar course has been observed in
other cases where the title to a barony was <i>jure uxoris</i>, in which
condition may be included the state of the second husband of a countess,
there being instances of men in that position being summoned to
parliament<a id="Page_206"></a> <span class="pagenum">[206]</span> <i>as barons</i>, whilst the countesses their wives were
living, and no longer. Thus it is possible that Fitz-Warine was
summoned, because he had married the countess and "queen;" and his son
Ivo was not summoned, because he was the son of Amicia Haddon.</p>

<p>With regard to the titles of King or Queen of Man, they do not appear to
be recognised by records, but merely by the chroniclers. Dugdale has
quoted from the history of Thomas de la Marc, that William, Earl Of
Salisbury, having in 16 Edw. III. (1342) conquered the Isle of Man (from
the Scots), the king gave him the inheritance, and <i>crowned him king
thereof</i>; and Walsingham and Otterbourne (p. 153.) relate that the
Vice-Chamberlaine, Sir William Scrope, in 16 Ric. II. (1393) purchased
the sovereignty of the Isle of Man <i>cum corona</i>. But the word <i>dominus</i>,
not <i>rex</i>, is employed in Latin records, and <i>seigneur</i> in French. On
the seal of the first Earl of Salisbury he is styled <i>dominus de dynbi
et mannie</i>, and on his counterseal <i>dominus de man et de dynbi</i>; and on
a counter or privy seal of the second earl he is styled <i>dominus mannie
et de dynbi</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Denbigh, not "Derby," as misprinted in p. 132.
<i>antea</i>). These seals have been recently engraved in the Salisbury
volume of the Archæological Institute. The second earl in his will, made
the 20th April, 1397, styles himself "Earl of Salisbury and Lord of the
Isles of Man and Wiht," although he had then sold the lordship of Man
some years before. In the Harleian charters is a bond from the purchaser
to the famous Sir Richard Whityngton, citizen and mercer of London,
dated 29th Aug. 1393, in which he is described as "William le Scrope,
Seigneur de Man et des Isles;" and in the truce with France on the 10th
March, 1394, "Monsieur Gwilliam le Scrope" is recorded to have assented
to the proceedings "pour le seigneury de Man," as one of the <i>allies</i> of
the King of England. (<i>F&oelig;dera</i>, iii. part iv. p. 95.) It is not easy
to determine when or where these potent subjects really assumed the rank
or title of "king" and "queen;" and it must be recollected that the King
of England himself was at the same period content to call himself only
"Lord of Ireland," as the Earl of Salisbury was "Lord of Man."</p>

<p>It may stimulate M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. G<span class="smcap lowercase">IBSON</span>, as a north countryman, to further
researches in this matter to remind him that it is to Katharine,
Countess of Salisbury, at the Castle of Wark in Northumberland, that Mr.
Beltz has traced the anecdote related by Froissart of the especial
admiration which King Edward III. conceived for a Countess of Salisbury;
connected with which are some of the legendary stories of the origin of
the Order of the Garter (see <i>Memorials of the Garter</i>, pp. 63. et
seq.). It would be a remarkable fact to ascertain that the object of the
king's gallantry became afterwards even a nominal queen.</p>

<p>&mdash;The criticisms of your correspondent
R<span class="smcap lowercase">ECHABITE</span> are of so singular a character, that I must beg him to excuse
my passing over, <i>unnoticed</i>, the first paragraph.</p>

<p>The second appears calculated to traduce the character of a man
celebrated for his integrity, judgment, accurateness, preciseness, and
skill in his sketches, &amp;c. The <i>Inscriptio Persepolitana</i>, p. 333., is
his own sketch: "Verum, unius descriptio tam longam mihi facessebat
operam (ob loci altitudinem et solares radios permolestam) ut parum
abesset, quin à ceteris abstinere coactus fuerim." (P. 332.) There were
three others: "Inscriptionis quadruplex quasi tabula spectatur." Perhaps
it may be one of the latter ones that R<span class="smcap lowercase">ECHABITE</span> has seen in Niebuhr and

<p>Next, why does R<span class="smcap lowercase">ECHABITE</span> not say what are the <i>two letters</i> which I have

<p>And now for my <i>theory</i>, and Major Rawlinson's improved translation of
the inscription, all together. Let the reader of "N. &amp; Q." turn to
Kæmpfer, p. 341., and he will see the procession that is described in p.

assure him that they are not mentioned. In fact, the engravings were
made long before the date 694 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, when Achæmenes began his reign. But
it appears that an Egyptian reed is thought sufficient to prop up a
structure raised in the sand.</p>

<p>Finally, my great desire is, that some spirited person would take up the
matter, and let the old and new system be tried by proper tests; and let

<h4>
<span><i>Parish Registers</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 473.; Vol. v., pp. 36. 141.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Notwithstanding the high legal tone which pervades the replies
you have received on Parish Registers, I cannot acquiesce in the
conclusion that "the genealogical or archæological inquirer has in
general no right to inspect," much less to copy, the Register Books.
What object could there be in enforcing the <i>keeping</i> and preservation
of registers by the officiating ministers, even under the pain of
transportation for fourteen years of any person wilfully injuring them,
and the cost to parishes for providing iron chests, except it be "for
the inspection of persons desirous to make search therein, and obtain
copies from and out of the same." (52 Geo. III. cap. 146.) And by the
act just quoted, the minister and the public are bound with regard to
fees due on searching, and for copies. He is entitled "to all due legal
and <i>accustomed</i> fees on such occasions, and all powers and remedies for
recovery thereof." And by the 49th section of a more recent Registration
Act (6 &amp; 7 Wm. IV.), registers of baptisms and burials may still be
kept, and, by inference, the fees are included; because by the 35th
section the fees for the examination of the registers created by this
last act are defined; but then they apply only to those registers, the
power of that act being only prospective, not retrospective.</p>

<p>The following note, made many years ago, from Phillip's <i>Law of
Evidence</i> (which, from the number of editions it has passed through,
must be supposed to be a work of considerable weight), will probably set
the question at rest, as he refers to adjudged cases:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Parish registers are public books, and persons interested in
   them have a right to inspect and take copies of such parts as
   relate to their interest.&mdash;Geery <i>v.</i> Hopkins, 2 <i>Lord Raym.</i>
   850.; Warriner <i>v.</i> Giles, 2 <i>Stra.</i> 954.; Mayor of Lond. <i>v.</i>
   Swinhead, 1 <i>Barnardist.</i> 454."</p>

<p>The reply, therefore, to the Query of D. (Vol. iv., p. 474.) seems to
be, that any person has a right to consult the parish registers, not
<i>gratuitously</i>, but on payment of the <i>accustomed</i> fee.</p>

the Peace</i> for 31st January, 1852, wherein, at p. 76., he will find an
opinion given, that, for the search the clergyman has a right to charge
1<i>s.</i> and no more, whatever may be the number of names, unless the
search extended over a period of more than one year, when he would be

<span><i>Ornamental Hermits</i></span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 123.).</span>

<p>&mdash;Some fancy of this kind at Mr.
Weld's of Lulworth Castle, in Dorsetshire, exaggerated or highly
coloured by O'Keefe, was supposed to afford the title and principal
incident of his extravagant but laughable comedy of <i>The London Hermit;
or, Rambles in Dorsetshire</i>, first played in 1793, with great success,
and revived (cut down to a two-act farce) in 1822. I, too, have heard
the story as told of Mr. Hamilton and Payne's Hill; but I a little doubt
it, because in the elaborate and somewhat pompous description of Payne's
Hill there is no mention of the <i>Hermitage</i>; and when I saw it as a show
place a great many years ago, I saw no building of that description;
but, after all, this may have been the original story which O'Keefe
transported into Dorsetshire.</p>

<span><i>Collars of SS.</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., pp. 81. 183.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Allow me to correct one or
two errors into which your correspondent H. L. has fallen.</p>

<p>In the first place, my letter was not intended (nor, I conceive, was
that of your correspondent L<span class="smcap lowercase">LEWELLYN</span>) either to support a favourite
theory, or to combat a long-established prejudice; but simply to furnish
a contribution to M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> F<span class="smcap lowercase">OSS'S</span> list of monumental effigies decorated with
this "much-vext" ornament.</p>

<p>As to the mistakes (if mistakes they be) which H. L. assumes, they are
not mine, but those of persons whose authority on these subjects H. L.
(like the celebrated reviewer who criticised Pindar's Greek without
knowing it) might find it awkward to impugn.</p>

<p>I may as well inform him, by the way, that the <i>corf de mailles</i>, which
originally covered the whole head, as a sort of cowl, was diminished in
size until it became little more than a gorget of mail; and appears at
last to have formed a portion of the hauberk. The name also changed its
orthography: passing, as has been suggested, through the intervening
stage of <i>cap-mail</i>, until it was corrupted into <i>camail</i>. There is,
therefore, no ground for "assuming" the ignorance of persons who use the
<i>original</i>, instead of the <i>corrupted</i> form of a word.</p>

<p>Perhaps H. L. has never heard of a helmet being worn over a bascinet. I
can furnish him with a <i>few</i> instances of monumental effigies where both
appear. He should study the monument in question before he pronounces
the use of the word "helmet" to be a mistake.</p>

<p>I would suggest to H. L. that the next time he appears in your pages he
had better append his name in full, that those whom he assails may be
better able to judge of the value of his criticism.</p>

<p>I will only add that it is hardly fair to "assume" that a man has never
studied a subject which has been his hobby for thirty years; and who
might be able to prove, by ocular demonstration, that he has "studied"
more monumental effigies than H. L. probably ever dreamt of.</p>

<span><i>Herschel Anticipated</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 233., &amp;c.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;It was not Herschel's
discoveries relative to the sun's motion, but his theory relative to its
physical<a id="Page_208"></a> <span class="pagenum">[208]</span> constitutions, which was anticipated by a person, who
was declared to be mad for holding such opinions. Sir David Brewster, in
a note to his edition of Ferguson's
 <i>Astronomy</i>, vol. ii. p. 144., says:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "It is a curious fact that the opinions of Dr. Herschel,
   respecting the nature of the sun, were maintained by a Dr.
   Elliot, who was tried at the Old Bailey for shooting Miss
   Boydell. The friends of the Doctor maintained that he was insane,
   and called several witnesses to establish this point. Among these
   was Dr. Simmons, who declared that Dr. Elliot had, for some
   months before, shown a fondness for the most extravagant
   opinions; and that in particular, he had sent to him a letter on
   the light of the celestial bodies, to be communicated to the
   Royal Society. This letter confirmed Dr. Simmons in the belief
   that this unhappy man was under the influence of this mental
   derangement; and, as a proof of the correctness of this opinion,
   he directed the attention of the court to a passage of the
   letter, in which Dr. Elliot states, 'that the light of the sun
   proceeds from a dense and universal aurora, which may afford
   ample light to the inhabitants of the surface (of the sun)
   beneath, and yet be at such a distance aloft as not to annoy
   them.' No objection, says he, ariseth to that great luminary
   being inhabited; vegetation may obtain there, as well as with us.
   There may be water and dry land, hills and dales, rain and fair
   weather; and as the light, so the season, must be eternal;
   consequently it may easily be conceived to be by far the most
   blissful habitation of the whole system." (See the <i>Gentleman's
   Magazine</i>, 1787, p. 636.)</p>

<span>(Vol. v., p. 13.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The editorial reply to
A<span class="smcap lowercase">N</span> M.D. seems to me very unsatisfactory. Would it not be more reasonable
to refer the custom to the Scandinavian mythology, wherein the mistletoe
is dedicated to Friga, the Venus of the Scandinavians; especially when
we remember that previous to the introduction of Christianity, the feast
of Thor was celebrated by the Northmen at nearly the same period? a fact
which also accounts for the Bacchanalian character of the Christian
feast. Students of the Edda will remember the importance of the
mistletoe in the Scandinavian legends; the story of Loke's attack on
Balder hinging upon the parasite character of the plant. It is worth a
note in passing, that the holly owes its importance in the Christmas
festivities to paganism. The Romans dedicated the holly to Saturn, whose
festival was held in December; and the early Christians, to screen
themselves from persecution, decked their houses with its branches
during their own celebration of the Nativity.</p>

<span><i>The Ring Finger</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 114.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I allow all that has been said,
though the Rubric in our Prayer Book directs the ring to be placed <i>on</i>
the fourth finger, and held there, &amp;c. Still I have read of the earliest
custom being, after repeating the words "With this ring I thee wed,"
&amp;c., on coming to "In the name of the Father," to place the ring on the
top of the thumb; "and of the Son," to place it on the top of the
forefinger; "and of the Holy Ghost," to place it on the top of the third
finger; <i>and</i>, on repeating the word "amen," to put the ring <i>down</i> over
the fourth finger; thereby "ratifying, and confirming the same." This
seems the most <i>serious</i> conclusion of the matter.</p>

<span><i>Sanctus Bell</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 104.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The <i>Glossary of Architecture</i> is
right in its description, but not in its conclusion. There are many
instances where the <i>Sanctus Bell</i>, or its remains, still exist in the
tower or bell chamber. As <i>e.g.</i> at Addington, Bucks, the "Parson's
Bell," as it is now called there, is to be seen in a small aperture in
the wall of the bell-chamber, exposed to the outside, on the west. A
similar aperture, size, and position, but <i>minus</i> the bell, can also be
seen in the tower of Merriott, Somerset. The recess in the wall of the
tower of Trumpington Church was clearly for the sacristan (perhaps) to
stand in to ring the bell. In the ringing chamber in the tower of
Halstock, Dorset, is a <i>wedge-like</i> aperture in the wall next the nave;
it is about three feet square, and <i>splays</i> from a narrow slit in the
church over the tower arch. This was evidently for the sacristan to
observe the proper times for ringing the bell. The top of the tower,
bell-chamber, &amp;c., had been rebuilt about a hundred years since, which
may account for no loop-hole now to be seen. No doubt there are many
others.</p>

</h4>

<p>&mdash;For several
years past I have had by me a little memorandum in the handwriting of a
friend. It states that Baskerville was once foreman to a stonemason,
during which time he had cut some lines upon the tombstone of a poor
idiot, who was buried in Edgbaston churchyard. The lines are these:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>"If th' Innocent are favourites of Heaven,</p>
    <p>And little is required where little's given,</p>
    <p>My great Creator has for me in store</p>
    <p>Eternal Bliss; what wise man would have more?"</p>

</div>

<p>A few days since (Jan. 26), being at Birmingham, I visited Edgbaston
churchyard, and on making inquiry for the above-mentioned tombstone, was
grieved to learn (from one who resembled the sexton) that nothing had
been heard of it since the year 1816. It seems that, with many other

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent
<span class="larger">&#9758;</span> F. is informed that Marwell Old Hall, formerly the
residence of the Seymour, and afterwards of the Dacre family, situate
between Winchester and Bishops Waltham, is connected by tradition with
the story of Ginevra; and the compiler of the <i>Post Office Directory of
Hampshire</i> (1848) states, that "<i>the chest, said to be the identical

village in the immediate locality, "<i>and may be seen in his entrance

<p>&mdash;B<span class="smcap lowercase">URIENSIS</span>
complains that "the inquiry of S<span class="smcap lowercase">TEPHEN</span> has not elicited one answer, nor
one additional note of other trees designated as <i>Gospel Oaks</i>." I
conjecture that the cause of this silence is, that the oaks so called
have long since perished. In this neighbourhood there are two iron-works
situated near the boundary of the parishes of Tipton and Wednesbury,
which are called respectively <i>Gospel Oak</i> Works and Wednesbury <i>Oak</i>
Works. The tradition respecting the name of <i>Gospel Oak</i> is, that it was
so called in consequence of it having been the practice in ancient times
to read under a tree which grew there, a<a id="Page_210"></a> <span class="pagenum">[210]</span> portion of the Gospels
on the annual perambulation of the bounds of the parish on Ascension
Day. That <i>Gospel Oak</i> and Wednesbury <i>Oak</i> marked the boundary line of
the parishes of Tipton and Wednesbury is highly probable.</p>

<p>Your correspondent B<span class="smcap lowercase">URIENSIS</span> (Vol. v. p. 157.) has supplied a quotation
from Mr. Hollingsworth to the effect, that these ancient trees were
probably Druidical, under whose "leafy tabernacles" the first Christian
missionaries preached. This view of their origin is borne out by the
ordinary practice of Christian missionaries to the Heathen of the
present day, who are frequently driven to the shelter of some umbrageous
giant of the forest, to deliver the Word of Life. In some cases I
imagine that it may be found that such trees have been rendered sacred
by the superstition of the native inhabitants; and it is scarcely
venturing too much in supposing, that as the moral wilderness becomes
cultivated, that similar traditions with our own may be handed down to
future generations, and especially if we look so far forward as to the
time when the sable inhabitants of the centre of Africa may in their
progress be occupied by curious questions of a bygone age in <i>their</i> "N.

<p>I quite agree with your correspondent B<span class="smcap lowercase">URIENSIS</span> as to the origin of the
title given to various old oak trees in different parts of the country.
These trees were no doubt selected on account of either their position,
age, or size, as places of assembly for the early Christians, and from
them the "Gospel" was, probably, first preached in their respective
neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>That these trees were connected with religious observances is evident
from the following lines in the 502nd poem of Herrick's <i>Hesperides</i>.
The poem is addressed "To Anthea:"&mdash;</p>

   purses to the relief of the beggar tribe would do well to take a
   readily-learned lesson as to the folly of that misguided
   benevolence which encourages and perpetuates vagabondism. Every
   door or passage is pregnant with instruction as to the error
   committed by the patron of beggars, as the beggar-marks show that
   a system of free-masonry is followed, by which a beggar knows
   whether it will be worth his while to call into a passage or
   knock at a door. Let any one examine the entrances to the
   passages in any town, and there he will find chalk marks,
   unintelligible to him, but significant enough to beggars. If a
   thousand towns are examined, the same marks will be found at
   every passage entrance. The passage mark is a cypher with a
   twisted tail: in some cases the tail projects into the passage,
   in others outwardly; thus seeming to indicate whether the houses
   down the passage<a id="Page_211"></a> <span class="pagenum">[211]</span> are worth calling at or not. Almost every
   door has its marks: these are varied. In some cases there is a
   cross on the brick-work, others, a cypher: the figures 1, 2, 3
   are also used. Every person may for himself test the accuracy of
   these statements by the examination of the brickwork near his own

<span><i>Fouché's Memoirs.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;At Vol. iv., p. 455., on the subject of the Duc
d'Enghien's murder, Fouché's <i>Memoirs</i> are quoted in proof that the
saying, "C'était pire qu'un crime, c'était une faute," was claimed as
his own by that famous police minister. Indeed, I have little doubt of
the fact, which, however, can derive no confirmation or authority from
the quoted work; for this nominal autobiography has been pronounced, on
a regular trial before the French tribunals, an utter cheat and
imposition; though referred to by Mr. Alison, in his <i>History of
Europe</i>, volume the fifth, p. 482. (original edition), as genuine, as
well as by Lord Brougham in the third volume of his <i>Statesmen</i>; yet
with less decided assertion than by the Scotch historian. Fouché's
family at once denounced the fabrication, and obtained heavy damages
from the printer; who equally succeeded against the writer, Alphons de
Beaumont, and was awarded large damages for the imposition. (See
<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for November, 1842.) It is at present perfectly
understood that the sharp and apt antithesis, however immoral, was
Fouché's.</p>

<p>Talleyrand's reputation for ready wit fixed on him the paternity of
numerous <i>bons mots</i>, which have proved to be of alien birth. Voltaire,
Piron, Mirabeau, in France; and Chesterfield, Selwyn, Wilkes, &amp;c. in
England; with Curran in Ireland, and many others, have similarly
obtained credit for pointed expressions not of their utterance, as to
the rich are generally given by rumour more than they possess. "On ne
prête qu'aux riches," is an apposite proverb, long since indeed stated
by the sententious Euripides: "<span title="[Greek: Horôssi de hoi didontes
eis ta chrêmata]">&#8009;&#961;&#8182;&#963;&#963;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#959;&#7985;

 &#967;&#961;&#8053;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>" (<i>In Fragmentis</i>). Cicero tells us, in his letter to
Volumnius (<i>Epistol. Famil.</i> lib. vii. ep. 32.), that the sayings of
others had been thus similarly fathered on him: "Ais omnia omnium dicta
in me conferri;" and complains, half-humorously and half-seriously, that
his supremacy of wit was not sufficiently protected from usurpers or
intruders: "Quod parum diligenter possessio <i>salinarum mearum</i>, ate
procuratore, defenditur," &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The best representation I have ever seen of the pelican feeding her
young occurs in the works of a Roman printer, in the early part of the
eighteenth century, Rocco Bernabo, who has taken for his device a
pelican feeding her five young ones, a crown of thorns encircling
them.<a id="Page_212"></a> <span class="pagenum">[212]</span></p>

<p>The pelican has a long bag or pouch, reaching the entire length of the
bill to the neck. In feeding its young, the bird squeezes the food
deposited in the bag into their mouths, by strongly compressing it upon
its breast with the bill. (See Calmet and Shaw.) Hence the popular idea.</p>

Welsh Saints; but I apprehend that the authority of the commissioners of
Henry VIII. may be deemed sufficient for placing his name in the next
edition of the Calendar that shall be published.</p>

<p>The quotation from <i>Bosworth</i> is doubtless correct. Blomfield, in his
<i>History of Norfolk</i>, when describing <i>Stoke-ferry</i>, says:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"This town stands on the river Wissey, and in the Book of
   Domesday it is wrote '<i>Stoches</i>;' not taking its name from
   <i>stoch</i>, (i.e.) some wood, but from <i>stow</i>, a dwelling or
   habitation, and <i>ches</i>, or <i>kes</i>, by the water."</p>

<p>There are two villages of the name of <i>Stoke</i> in Norfolk, and both are
situate on small streams.</p>

<span><i>A Baron's Hearse</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 128.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The editorial reply in this page
has referred to the Note on Funerals which I prefixed to <i>Machyn's
Diary</i>; and from that book may certainly be gathered the best possible
notion of the style and character of the hearse, and other paraphernalia
attendant upon funerals in England during the sixteenth century. But in
a book which I edited for another Society, namely, <i>The Unton
Inventories</i>, 1841, will be found the authority for Lloyd's statement
relative to the funeral of Sir Henry Unton: it is the certificate in the
College of Arms, which states that he was buried at Faringdon "with a
baron's hearse, and in the degree of a baron, because he died ambassador
leidger for France." A Lord Mayor of London, dying in office, was in
like manner interred with the observances due to a baron. It appears
from Sir Henry Unton's papers that he was usually addressed as "My Lord"
whilst in France as ambassador. May I inquire whether that practice is
still kept up towards ambassadors who are not peers? or, if not, when
did it cease?</p>

<h3>
<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</span>
</h3>

<p>When we remember the ill-drawn and gaudily coloured prints with which,
until these few years, it was the fashion to illustrate all books
intended for the use and amusement of young people, we cannot but be
forcibly struck with the improvement which has taken place in this
respect. These remarks have been suggested to us by a couple of
children's books just issued by Messrs. Addey, in the illustration of
which those tasteful publishers have employed the able pencil of Hablot
Browne. The first, <i>Home and its Pleasures, Simple Stories for Young
People</i>, by Mrs. Harriet Myrtle, contains eight admirable designs; while
<i>Aunt Effie's Rhymes for Little Children</i>&mdash;and Aunt Effie is a most
capital writer of Rhymes for Babyland&mdash;is enriched with no less than
twenty-four illustrations, some of which are rich in the peculiar humour
of this artist. To the same house we are also indebted for a work of
still higher interest, namely, a new and complete edition of <i>The Danish
Fairy Legends and Tales</i>, by Hans Christian Andersen, containing
(besides a Memoir of the Author) no less than forty-five tales,
translated direct from the original language, and not through any German
version. This will be good news to all who know and admire the playful
humour and deep imaginings of the great Danish Story Teller.</p>

<p><i>Child's Play, Seventeen Drawings by E. V. B.</i>, demands notice, not as a
work of literature, but of Art, and Art of a very high order. For fancy,
grace, and simplicity, these exquisite illustrations of some of our old
Nursery Rhymes may challenge comparison with any works of a similar
character with which we are acquainted. Produced by the Anastatic
process, they show how available that process may be made to the<a id="Page_214"></a> <span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
requirements of the amateur: for, admirable as are these designs, they
owe their existence to the taste and artistic skill of a lady; for we
believe "E. V. B." designates the Hon. Mrs. Boyle. Little wonder, as
poor Theodore Hook would have said, to find one of the <i>Cork</i> family
distinguished for <i>drawing</i>.</p>

<p>B<span class="smcap lowercase">OOKS</span> R<span class="smcap lowercase">ECEIVED</span>.&mdash;<i>The Relations between the Holy Scriptures and some
parts of Geological Science</i>, the fifth edition of a well-known and much
esteemed work by the late Dr. Pye Smith, forms the new issue of Bohn's
<i>Scientific Library</i>. His <i>Antiquarian Library</i> has been enriched by the
publication of the second volume of <i>The Works of Sir Thomas Browne</i>,
containing the last three books of the <i>Vulgar Errors</i>, his <i>Religio
Medici</i>, and <i>The Garden of Cyrus</i>. The fifth volume of <i>The Works of
Plato</i>, containing the <i>Laws</i>, translated by George Burges, has been
added to the <i>Classical Library</i>. <i>Home Truths for Home Peace</i>, or,
<i>"Muddle" Defeated; a Practical Inquiry into what chiefly mars or makes
the Comfort of Domestic Life, chiefly addressed to Young Housewives</i>, is
an attempt at the exposure and destruction of their most insidious and
deadly enemy, and deserves to be well known for the good sense, right
feeling, and quaint humour, with which its praiseworthy object is
inculcated. Lebahn's <i>Henry von Eichenfels</i>, <i>Wonderful History of Peter
Schlemihl</i>, <i>Egmont by Goethe</i>, <i>Wilhelm Tell by Schiller</i>. Although
there is no royal road to learning, it is unquestionable that the
journey may be shortened, and the path rendered less wearisome by the
company of judicious guides. The four books edited by M. Falck Lebahn,
whose titles we have just enumerated, consisting of well-known
masterpieces of his country's literature, each accompanied by a
vocabulary, complete, both as regards the words and the difficult
phrases in the several works to which they are attached, belong to this
class, and will greatly facilitate the self instructor in his
acquirement of a language which is not only one of the richest in Europe
in indigenous works, but far richer than any other in its translations
from all other languages.</p>

<p class="center larger">TOMB OF THE TRADESCANTS.</p>

<p>In Lambeth Churchyard is a Monument, once handsome and elaborately
carved, which was erected in 1662 by the widow of
JOHN TRADESCANT the
younger, to the memory of her father-in-law, her husband, and her son,
who were inhabitants of that parish.</p>

<p>The Monument of the TRADESCANTS, which was repaired by public
subscription in 1773, has now again fallen into decay. The inscription
also on the stone that covers ASHMOLE'S grave, who was himself buried in
Lambeth Church, is now very nearly effaced. The restoration of that
Church, now nearly finished, seems a fit occasion for repairing both
these Monuments. It is therefore proposed to raise a fund for the
perfect restoration of the Tomb of the TRADESCANTS, according to its
original form, as represented in two drawings preserved in the Pepysian
Library at Cambridge, and also for renewing ASHMOLE'S epitaph. The cost
will not be less than 100<i>l.</i>, and assistance is earnestly requested
from all who are anxious to preserve ancient monuments, especially those
who are following the same pursuits as the TRADESCANTS, and who are
daily deriving benefit and delight from the labours and discoveries of
these first of English gardeners and naturalists.</p>
